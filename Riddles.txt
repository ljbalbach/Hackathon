Adriana's mom had four kids: Marta, Anna, Justina...
A man pushed his car past a hotel, only to realize he was bankrupt. How did he figure this out? (He did not have his wallet on him, or in the car)
(This is fairly easy, but it'll have an impact on your final result!) If there are 100000000 bricks on a plane, and one falls off, how many are left?
The dead bodies of Bob and Ann are lying on the floor. They are naked and wet. Their bodies have absolutely no cuts. The windows are open to the house they live in, and it is stormy. How did they die?
Imagine you're in a dark room that is perfectly empty with nothing in it. There are no windows or doors. What is the easiest way to escape?
